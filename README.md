### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I was working on and off. But total I probably spent around 5 hours.
Most of the time I spent doing UI using SwiftUI, because I didn't use it much in the past.
Also implementing ImageView with caching functionality took some time.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Not really, this is a pretty easy project didn't make much trade-offs. Possibly I could spend more time making UI prettier.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project? 
Caching ImageView could be better, where we can setup some parameters like cache size etc.
Probably could add more tests.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
